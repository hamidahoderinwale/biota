      <p><b><span style="color: #43AA8B">Biota</span></b> is a fellowship program for motivated undergraduates and
        recent grads to work on building startups in
        emerging markets. It involves an online fellowship component alongside a 3-month residency in <a

      </p>

      <p>We believe that the tech scene is moving fast, and things can move exceptionally fast in the developing world.
        Applicants donâ€™t need to have project ideas or team members to apply, though we encourage you to research what
        work would be the most meaningful to pursue. Ben Kuhn (the former CTO of <a
          href="https://www.sendwave.com/">Wave) outlines</a>
        the reasons
        why we
        think
        a program like this is valuable in his <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/emco/">post</a></p>

      <p>By providing a great place to work in an environment where you can gain local context, we hope to make it
        easier
        for locals and non-locals to look into building projects for the developing world.

    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) </h3>
    <p><b>What is a project?</b>

      A project can be anything that starts with you and your friends, can scale in an interesting way, and be something
      that people want. It doesn't necessarily have to involve code, applications, or products, and some of the highest
      leverage projects work directly with people instead of software.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>What if I'm already working on a project?</b>
      You can bring your project to Biota, but be open to the possibility of nudging it in a different direction,
      especially at the beginning. Additionally, if you don't have a partner for your project, Biota will do their best
      to help you find one.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Who is Biota for?</b>
      Biota is a fellowship program that targets driven undergraduates and recent graduates interested in constructing
      startups in developing markets. It also caters to those who are on a gap year or desire to work on a meaningful
      project they own or students who want to work on side projects to gain momentum for their careers. Biota is open
      to anyone who wishes to work with a community of like-minded project-oriented individuals.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>What are they looking for?</b>
      Biota is an inclusive program that doesn't have any specific requirements regarding majors, interests, or class
      years. Moreover, previous experience is not necessary to apply for this fellowship program. Biota is looking for
      individuals who have a passion for making a positive impact on society, critically analyze ways for improvements,
      and enjoy bringing abstract concepts to life.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Who will I be working on projects with?</b>
      Team-building will take place before the incubator program in the digital component. We encourage you to apply
      with a team-member, but we also encourage taking the opportunity to work with someone new.
